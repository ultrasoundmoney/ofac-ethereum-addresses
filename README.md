Ethereum addresses added to the OFAC SDN list
===

This repository contains both the list of addresses and a python script to automatically generate and update it. Community-maintained list of Ethereum addresses added to [the OFAC SDN list](https://sanctionslist.ofac.treas.gov/Home/SdnList) can be found below.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The list is automatically generated by:
1. Downloading the latest SDN CSV from the OFAC API
2. Extracting 0x addresses from entries containing "Digital Currency Address"
3. Detecting truncated entries (rows truncated at 1000 characters)
4. Querying the OFAC sanctions search database for complete data on truncated entries
5. Deduplicating results and updating `data.csv` and README.md.

**Note**: This list may be inacurate—corrections are welcome!

**Note**: A CSV with the data is available [here](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/ofac-ethereum-addresses/blob/main/data.csv).

**Note**: Eden keeps track of OFAC addresses onchain [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x97044531D0fD5B84438499A49629488105Dc58e6).
